Feature Extraction
==================

The ``TimeSeriesFeatureExtractor`` class provides comprehensive feature extraction from time series data, extracting 74+ features across multiple categories for machine learning applications.

Overview
--------

The feature extractor is designed to capture the essential characteristics of time series data that are relevant for Hurst exponent estimation. It provides features in several categories:

- **Statistical Features**: Basic statistical measures
- **Spectral Features**: Frequency domain characteristics
- **Wavelet Features**: Time-frequency analysis
- **Fractal Features**: Self-similarity measures
- **Biomedical Features**: Domain-specific characteristics

Basic Usage
-----------

.. code-block:: python

    from neurological_lrd_analysis import TimeSeriesFeatureExtractor
    import numpy as np

    # Create feature extractor
    extractor = TimeSeriesFeatureExtractor()

    # Generate sample data
    data = np.random.randn(1000)

    # Extract features
    features = extractor.extract_features(data)
    print(f"Extracted {len(features)} features")

    # Display feature names and values
    for name, value in features.items():
        print(f"{name}: {value:.4f}")

Advanced Usage
--------------

Custom Feature Extraction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

    # Extract specific feature categories
    extractor = TimeSeriesFeatureExtractor()

    # Extract only statistical features
    statistical_features = extractor.extract_statistical_features(data)

    # Extract only spectral features
    spectral_features = extractor.extract_spectral_features(data)

    # Extract only wavelet features
    wavelet_features = extractor.extract_wavelet_features(data)

Batch Processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

    # Extract features from multiple time series
    data_list = [np.random.randn(1000) for _ in range(10)]
    
    all_features = []
    for data in data_list:
        features = extractor.extract_features(data)
        all_features.append(list(features.values()))
    
    # Convert to numpy array for ML training
    X = np.array(all_features)
    print(f"Feature matrix shape: {X.shape}")

Feature Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

    # Get feature names for selection
    feature_names = list(extractor.extract_features(data).keys())
    print(f"Available features: {len(feature_names)}")

    # Select specific features
    selected_features = ['mean', 'variance', 'skewness', 'kurtosis']
    selected_indices = [feature_names.index(f) for f in selected_features]
    
    # Extract only selected features
    X_selected = X[:, selected_indices]
    print(f"Selected features shape: {X_selected.shape}")

Performance Considerations
--------------------------

Memory Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The feature extractor is designed to be memory-efficient:

- Features are computed on-demand
- No unnecessary data is stored
- Efficient algorithms for large datasets

Computation Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Feature extraction time scales with data length:

- **Short series** (< 1000 points): ~1-10ms
- **Medium series** (1000-5000 points): ~10-100ms
- **Long series** (> 5000 points): ~100ms-1s

Optimization Tips
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For best performance:

1. **Use appropriate data length**: 1000-2000 points is optimal
2. **Batch processing**: Extract features for multiple series at once
3. **Feature selection**: Use only relevant features for your application
4. **Memory management**: Process data in chunks for very large datasets

Troubleshooting
---------------

Common Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Memory Errors**
- Reduce data length or process in chunks
- Use feature selection to reduce dimensionality

**Computation Time**
- Use shorter time series for real-time applications
- Consider using only essential features

**Feature Quality**
- Ensure data is properly preprocessed
- Check for NaN or infinite values
- Use appropriate data length (1000-2000 points recommended)

Best Practices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and normalize data before feature extraction
2. **Feature Selection**: Use domain knowledge to select relevant features
3. **Validation**: Always validate features on test data
4. **Documentation**: Keep track of which features are used in your models
